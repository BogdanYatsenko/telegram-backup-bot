# telegram-backup-bot
Telegram Backup Bot is a lightweight, reliable way to archive chat history. It processes messages asynchronously, stores text/captions in SQLite, and saves attachments (photos, videos, documents, voice notes, stickers, etc.) to disk. Minimal setup via .env, powered by python-telegram-bot v21 and a clean SQLAlchemy schema.
